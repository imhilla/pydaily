#  unpacking a sequence into separate variables

# problem
# you have an N-element tuple or sequence that would like to unpack into a collection on N variables.

# solution
# Any sequence (or iterable) can be unpacked into variables using a simple
# assignment operation. The only requirement is that the number of variables and structure match the sequence

# Discussion
# unpacking actually works with any object that happens to be iterable, not just tuples
# or lists, includes strings, files, iterators and generators.

# used terminal to test and solve
